# Sudoku Solver Application
A Java application for finding solutions for the traditional Suodku game. It also determines if the board state is valid, in addition to whether a solution exists at all (some games don't have one).

### Installation
Download 'sudoku_solver.jar' from Executable(demo) folder

### How to Use
Enter numbers 0-9 in the textfields (don't worry, it automatically determines if your input is valid). Either 0 or just leaving it empty will show that board space being empty.
